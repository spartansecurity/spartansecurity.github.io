This year has been a pretty good year with so many changes to come. Sadly, our term as officers are slowly coming to an end. Two weeks ago we had our officer elections. We will have to leave it up to the next batch of volunteers to carry the club to new heights. We've set the stage, Let's see how you perform. 

I would like to congratulate: 

Matt Chi: 	President
Calvin Nixon: 	Vice-President
Christine Le: 	Treasurer
Emily Dao: 	Secretary
Vivi Langga: 	Web Administrator
Dustin Tran: 	CTF Lead
Hansen Wu:  	External Relations Director

We all look forward to your great leadership.
