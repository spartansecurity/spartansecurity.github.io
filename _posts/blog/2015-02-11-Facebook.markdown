The club has been starting to expand. With the help of Calvin, our External Relations Director, we were able to have the Director of Facebook Security (In which Ted Reed came in her presence) come to the Information Security club to talk about Facebook Security and the beginnings of our collaboration with them. Calvin has a big plan to get this club to be the next big thing. With that in mind, I hope you enjoyed the talk and look forward to even more. We would like to thank Facebook for taking some of their time to speak with the club.
