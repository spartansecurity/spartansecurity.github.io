      <p>The Information Security (Infosec) Club at San Jos√© State University was founded in late 2013 by a group of aspiring computer security professionals comprised of undergraduate, graduate, and alumni students from different majors with a strong sense of mission and a shared vision to increase awareness of the current issues surrounding cyber security. To accomplish this, the Infosec Club offers opportunities for members to gain hands-on experience practicing relevant skills such as reverse engineering, forensic analysis, exploit development, toolkit creation, vulnerability discovery, code auditing, and more.</p>
